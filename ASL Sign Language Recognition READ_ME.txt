🧠 ASL Sign Language Recognition
University Deep Learning Project
1- Project Description
This project presents a Deep Learning–based system for recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) letters and words from images and video frame sequences.
The system combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for letter recognition with Transformer-based models for word recognition, all integrated into a simple and user-friendly Streamlit graphical interface.
2- Project Objectives
Recognize ASL alphabet letters from single images
Recognize ASL words from sequences of frames
Apply modern Deep Learning techniques (CNNs and Transformers)
Provide an intuitive and easy-to-use graphical user interface
3- System Overview
The system consists of two main recognition pipelines:
🔹 Letters Recognition
Model: CNN (ResNet18)
Input: Single image
Output: Predicted ASL letter
🔹 Words Recognition
Model: CNN + Transformer Encoder
Input: Sequence of frames
Output: Predicted ASL word
The application is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to upload images or capture snapshots from a camera and receive predictions visually through the graphical interface.
4- Key Features
ResNet18-based CNN for accurate letter classification
Transformer-based architecture for word-level sequence recognition
Robust preprocessing and data augmentation
Complete training pipeline (Training, Validation, Testing)
Clean and minimal Streamlit GUI
Camera snapshot integration
Automatic class loading using ImageFolder directory structure
